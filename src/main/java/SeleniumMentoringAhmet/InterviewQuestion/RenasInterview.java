    What is MAVEN?
    Maven is a project management tool that help you organize your project and centralize your dependencies in one area
    (pom.xml)

    Interview Question ***
    Where do you get your dependencies?

    1) If my company has a repository, I will get my dependencies from there. If not, I will ask responsible
    person about where I can get a specific dependency.
    2) I will ask my Team Lead or PO where to get depositories

    NOTE : another project management tool is Gradle

    What is JIRA?
    It is a project management and bug tracking tool. Jira helps companies with how to manage their project workflow
    and tracking software bugs.
    Jira is not a open source. Its owned by Atlassian.
    Note: if you want to practice on Jira, you have 30 days free trial options. So please sign up and practice on it
    For manual test execution Jira has some plugins such as, XRay, Zephyr, QMetry
    Since Jira itself doesnt have an ability of Manual test execution, those plugins help you to do your
    test execution.

    Azure devops tool is alternative tool to jira and more powerful then jira because , you use it for bug tracking,
    project management, jenkins, git.
    I heard about azure devops, but didnt work professionally yet. I'd be happy to learn and challenge myself with
    new tools. That's other reason I applied for this position

   -------------

   Test Rail: it is another plugin for test execution
